# UL-TinyRenderer
A tiny software 3D offline renderer.

This repository is my homework for a 3D software offline rendering engine assignment for university.  
The original assignment repository can be found here: [A brief computer graphics / rendering course](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer)  
**Note:** This repository is entierly managed via Visual Studio.

# Known issues  
- Some artefacts appears when drawing lines inside triangles when a side is near horizontal.

# Roadmap
- [X] Render a single arbitrary line.  
- [X] Load an .obj file.
- [X] Do a simple wireframe rendering without projection.  
- [X] Fill triangles with a random color.  
- [X] Do a "solid" render of an .obj file. (Triangles filled, no textures)  
- [X] Add a lighting pass. (Extra: Add the support for multiple lights.)  
- [ ] Add a Z-Buffer.  
- [ ] Add a projection function.  
- [ ] Add diffuse texture rendering.  
- [ ] Add additionnal map passes. (normal, bump, etc...).
